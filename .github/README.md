# lush.awm

Lush is a library that is intended to be an alternative to the standard AwesomeWM library, with a new concept of creating widgets.

> ATTENTION: I don't have time to work on this project every day, it takes up a lot of my time while I could be working on other more important things. Not even 10% of the project is ready. Feel free to contribute.
